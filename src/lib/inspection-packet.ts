 * Turning stored records into printable ones.

 * `toPdfData` is what the single-resident export has always done, lifted out
 * of its route so the hallway packet feeds the renderer through exactly the
 * same function. One loader, one mapper, one template: a packet page and a
 * single-resident page are produced by identical code, which is the only way
 * "identical to the individual export" stays true as this changes.
 *
 * Everything here reads through the CALLER'S client — rows under their RLS,
 * blobs under their storage policies. There is no service-role path: a
 * packet can only ever contain records its requester could already open one
 * at a time.

 * `current_residents` supplies the other two halves of "right now" — it is
 * already scoped to the current term and to stays that are not archived — so
 * status is the only filter this has to apply itself.
 *
 * That also settles the awkward case by itself: someone who checked out of
 * one room and into another in this same hallway has two non-archived stays
 * this term (the partial unique index allows it, since only one of them is
 * active), and exactly one of them is `checked_in`. They appear once, under
 * the room they actually live in.
 *
 * A `checked_in` stay whose move-in inspection is somehow unsigned is
 * skipped rather than printed half-formed — record_occupancy makes that
 * impossible going forward, so it would only ever be legacy data.
